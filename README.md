## Intro:
This Repo simplifies generating annual Photovoltaic feedin time-series data using PVLib python (modelchain) [https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python].
## usage:
	* First download the python file [pvlib_gui_v2.py].
 	* Install all the requirements in your environment.
  	* Open the file into any IDE and run it.
   	* A window appears for inputs.
    * Then press the 'Load inputs' button and verify your data.
    * Press the 'Simulate' button.
For a detailed overview of each input, follow [user guide.pdf](https://github.com/vaijayanth-sheri/pvlib_GUI/files/13873014/user.guide.pdf)


## Note:
The project is designed and built for master thesis purposes. Hence, this GUI is not a full-scale interface for PVLib Python.
Most of the capabilities of this tool are built to address the master thesis requirements and further solve OEMOF models. 
While the PVlib python can do much more. read documentation [https://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io/]

 You can adjust the code lines in the program according to your requirements like changing the module and inverters.
